# 2DRenderMaster_C++
2DRenderMaster is an intuitive application that allows users to render simple 2D objects and manipulate them with ease. Users can <span style="color: orange;">**rotate**</span>, <span style="color: orange;">**translate**</span>, <span style="color: orange;">**scale**</span>, <span style="color: orange;">**move objects within a Z-buffer**</span>, and <span style="color: orange;">**change their colors**</span> effortlessly.

## How to get the application up and running
1. Download the files from the repository.
2. Move all files except "CMakeLists" to the "src" folder.
3. Create a new "build" using CMake (but you need to specify the correct path and version of your Qt in the "CMakeLists" file first).
4. In Visual Studio Community you need to "set "ImageViewer" as Startup project".
5. Now you can run the application.
