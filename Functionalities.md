## Drawing Shapes:
- Line defined by two points.
- Quadrilateral defined by two points.
- Polygon defined by n points.
- Circle defined by two points.
- BÃ©zier curve defined by n points.

## Rendering Order:
- Each newly drawn shape is rendered 'above' the previous one (each shape has a depth value for the Z-buffer).

## Shape Filling:
- Depending on UI choice, shapes can be filled or unfilled (applies only to closed polygons).

## Color Settings:
- The boundary and fill color are set globally but can be changed individually for each shape after drawing.

## Shape List:
- After drawing, shapes are added to a list of shapes.
- The list of drawn shapes is visible to the user in the UI as a list of layers, with one object per layer.

## Layer Selection:
- After selecting a layer, the user can:
  - Move, scale, and rotate the shape (coordinates are updated after transformation, and further transformations are applied to the updated coordinates).
  - Change the boundary and fill color of the shape.
  - Define a different depth value for the Z-buffer (move the shape above/below others).

## Saving and Loading:
- The current state of the program (shapes in layers, their colors, depth values, and canvas size) can be saved in a chosen format.
- The saved file can be loaded to continue working with the program.

## Rasterization Algorithms:
- Using Bresenham's algorithm for rasterizing all line segments.
- Using Bresenham's algorithm for rasterizing circles.
- Using the Scan-line algorithm for filling shapes.
- Using Cyrus-Beck and Sutherland-Hodgman algorithms for clipping (clipping circles is not required).
- Using the Z-buffer algorithm for visibility resolution.
